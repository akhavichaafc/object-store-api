= Auditing

https://javers.org/[JaVers] is used to save snapshots of DTOs on create, update and delete events. 

== Configure a DTO to be audited:

1. Add the Javers annotations to the DTO:

* @TypeName should be added to the class for JaVers to know the type.

* @Id and @PropertyName("id") should be added to the ID field, which JaVers uses to track multiple versions of
the same entity.

* @Value should be added to embedded objects, like other DTOs that are considered values of a parent DTO.
e.g. "AddressDto" is an embedded Value in "PersonDto", not a standalone entity.

** When a child value
is changed, the parent object should also be updated (via timestamp update). This can be done using
@PrePersist, @PreUpdate and @PreDelete annotations on the JPA Entity.

** Child values should not be audited separately, regardless of database structure.

* @DiffIgnore should be added to any fields not needed in the snapshots, like derived DTO fields.

2. Add a snapshot loader function in the SnapshotLoader class, which stores snapshots on JPA Entity
create/update/delete operations.

* Make sure to use "include" in the QuerySpec to include embedded DTOs or foreign-key related DTOs.

== Query the stored snapshots:

JSONAPI endpoint at /api/v1/audit-snapshot , implemented by the AuditSnapshotRepository class.

* Page results using query parameters page[limit] and page[offset].
* Filter the results:
** By author: `filter[author]=authorname`
** By instance: `filter[instanceId]=metadata/0fc10c52-91b6-4a9b-be98-e3f75b9928f7`
