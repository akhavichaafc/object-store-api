= Soft Delete

The object store uses soft deleting. 

When deleting a metadata, the record will still remain but will be hidden from the API.

*Get One By id*
----
 GET /metadata/{id}
----

Would Return HTTP *410 GONE* if the metadata was soft-deleted.

*Get all*

----
 GET /metadata/
----

Would not return any soft-deleted data to you.

=== Returning a Soft Deleted Entity

You can use crnks natural filtering to return a soft-deleted entity.

Adding the filter _?filter[deletedDate][NEQ]=null_ will allow queries on soft deleted metadata.

----
GET /metadata/{id}?filter[deletedDate][NEQ]=null

GET /metadata/?filter[deletedDate][NEQ]=null
----

Respectively these two requests would return one or multiple metadata including soft-deleted metadata.
